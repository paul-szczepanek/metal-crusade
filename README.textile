h1. Defunct

This is a corpse but feel free to poke it with a stick.

This is well beyond my capability for a hobby project. I moved to a project that has a more realistic scope so I can actually release 1.0 without having to quit my day job.

I wish it weren't so but this one's suspended indefinitely.

h1. Metal Crusade

This is a computer game - a tactical military mecha simulator. The game uses *OGRE* for rendering graphics and *OIS* for handling low-level input. It is currently being developed by me but I welcome anyone who would like to join in.

The game lets you pilot giant military robots (eponymous *crusaders*) with a third-person overhead view with stress put on tactics, both individual and group, and designing or customising your crusaders.

h2. Project Goals

The design doc is still being written but roughly:

* pilot the crusader and command your squad on the ground level map
* travel on a planet map and capture structures - involving global strategy and diplomacy, managing your gear and personnel
* design, build and customise crusaders for you and your squad to use
