h1. Metal Crusade

This is a computer game - a tactical military mecha simulator. The game uses *OGRE* for rendering graphics and *OIS* for handling low-level input. It is currently being developed by me but I welcome anyone who would like to join in.

The game lets you pilot giant military robots (eponymous *crusaders*) with a third-person overhead view with stress put on tactics, both individual and group, and designing or customising your crusaders.


h2. Project Status

The project is in its extremely early stage. The ground level section of the game is being developed - the one where you actually pilot the crusader. The art assets are all placeholders.


h2. Project Goals

The design doc is still being written but roughly:

* pilot the crusader and command your squad on the ground level map
* travel on a planet map and capture structures - involving global strategy and diplomacy, managing your gear and personnel
* design, build and customise crusaders for you and your squad to use
* story mode
* ...and lastly, networked co-op (ha, maybe in 2012)
